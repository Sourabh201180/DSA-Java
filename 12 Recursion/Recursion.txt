recursive call
        if you are calling a function again and again, you can treat it as a seperate call in the stack
        a term is defined in terms of itself, till it gets a specific condition done.

        if their is no base condition it will execute infinitely,
        so, it will generate StackOverflowError.

Recursion:-
        * a function calling itself.
        * we use it to solve bigger/complex problems in a single way.
        * you can convert the recursion solutions into iterations or vice versa.
        * space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.
        * helps to break down the bigger problems into smaller problems.
