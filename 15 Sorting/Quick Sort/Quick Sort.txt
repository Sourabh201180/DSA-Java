Quick Sort:
    pivot-> reference point/ any random element in the array.
            => after first pass
        all the elements < P will be on LHS of P.
        all the elements > P will be at the RHS of the P.

        5, 4, 3, 2, 1
            P->4
    pass 1:
        1, 3, 2    4    5
          P->3
       1, 2   3    4    5
          P->2

Q. how to put pivot at correct position?
    * Random element
    * Corner element
    * Middle element

Recurrence Relation of Quick sort:-
        T(N) = T(K) + T(N-K-1) + O(N)
 
    worst case: (pivot is largest/smallest) 
                i.e. k=0
            T(N) = T(N-1) + O(N)
                 = O(N^2)
 
    best case: (pivot is at center) 
                i.e. k=N/2
            T(N) = T(N/2) + T(N/2) + O(N)
                 = 2T(N/2) + O(N)
                 = O(N*log(N))


Notes:
    * Not stable.
    * In-place.
    * Merge Sort is better in linked lists due to memory allocation is not continuous.
