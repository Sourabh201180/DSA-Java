Insertion Sort: basically its sorted the elements before the particular element
        for every index:    
            put that index element at the correct index of RHS

            5, 3, 4, 1, 2

    pass 1: i=0,     
            j=1       3, 5, 4, 1, 2

    pass 2: i=1,     
            j=2       3, 4, 5, 1, 2

    pass 3: i=2,     
            j=3       1, 3, 4, 5, 2

    pass 4: i=3,     
            j=4       1, 2, 3, 4, 5


time complexity:=
             best case: O(N)     array is already sorted
            worst case: O(N^2)   desc order sorted

Space complexity:- 
                O(1) inplace sorting algorithm

Q. why to use it?
    * adaptive: steps get reduced if array is sorted.
                no. of swaps reduced as compared to bubble sorted

    * stable
    * used for smaller values of N:
        works well when array is partially sorted.
        it takes partially hybrid sorting algorithm.
